# Alexander Tsiklidis' COSMOS APP

## Overview

In the COSMOS APP a user will be able to read an index of celestial objects we have stored in our database, and obtain information on each individual celestial object stored in the database.

Additionally, a user will be able to delete as well as update an existing celestial object if new information or discovery has been made regarding the cosmos. All deletes and edits will be subject to review by our admins for accuracy, until we build a more robust operating system.

Lastly, a user will be able to create their own celestial object. This too is subject to admin review.

The Cosmos app is comprised of two repositiories a front-end application that communicates with a back-end server to render our celestial objects  and reply data.

## Getting Started

Please use the deployed front-end website on netlify(https://timely-gingersnap-37dfa8.netlify.app) and back-end server on render() in order to begin using our app

### Prerequisites

As stated previously, you will need to go live on both the front-end application and back-end server in order to make full use of teh COSMOS app

**Coming Soon!**

-More efficiently partitioned data such as moons seperate from planets, seperate from stars.

-Users will be able to build resources like moons, planets and stars that get stored underneath their own tabs

-Update input fields, and database to render more info on a planet.

-User authentication, where a user can only access CRUD functionality on the app by logging in.

**Stretch Goals!**

1- Hover effects and cohesive styling on every page
2- Uses extra field values for data in back-end (more then 7)
